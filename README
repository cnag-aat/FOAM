FOAM: "Flye ONT Assembly of Mitogenomes"

Contributors: Fernando Cruz, Jèssica Gómez and Tyler Alioto. Genome Assembly and Annotation Team (CNAG)

v0.2 changes:

- uses relative path to the scripts, modules and utils
- added a rule to rotate the reference genome to ensure also starts at the trnF gene (good for qc alignments)
